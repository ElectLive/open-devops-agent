- **Windows** (Server 2016/2019/2022) - with PowerShell, Event Logs

**File:** `collectors/server_enhanced.py` (NEW - 342 lines)
**Feature:** Auto-detects OS and runs appropriate diagnostics

### 3. How can it be used in an organization?

**Complete organizational deployment guide created:**

**File:** `ORGANIZATIONAL_GUIDE.md` (544 lines)

**Covers:**
- Deployment models (Centralized, Multi-Region, Team-Based)
- Team integration (DevOps, SRE, Security, Development)
- Workflow integration (Incident response, CI/CD, Monitoring)

**Usage:**
```python
from tools.fix_verifier import FixVerifier

verifier = FixVerifier()
result = await verifier.verify_fix(
    incident_type="k8s",
    fix_applied="Restarted pod",
    expected_state={"pod_status": "Running"}
)
# Returns: {"verified": True, "status": "success"}
```

### 5. After any fix manually it should create documentation

**File:** `tools/documentation_generator.py` (500+ lines)

**Generates:**
1. **Runbook** - Step-by-step fix procedure
2. **Postmortem** - Detailed incident report
3. **Knowledge Base** - Searchable documentation

**Location:** `documentation/` folder
- `runbooks/` - Fix procedures
- `postmortems/` - Incident reports
- `knowledge-base/` - Searchable articles

**Usage:**
```python
from tools.documentation_generator import DocumentationGenerator

generator = DocumentationGenerator()
files = generator.generate_fix_documentation(
    incident_id="INC-001",
    incident_type="k8s",
    problem_description="Pod CrashLoopBackOff",
    root_cause="Missing environment variable",
    fix_applied="Added ENV var",
    verification_steps=["Check pod status"],
    manual_commands=["kubectl edit deployment"],
    context={"severity": "High"},
    success=True
)
# Generates runbook, postmortem, and KB article
```

### 6. Should integrate with all DevOps tools
